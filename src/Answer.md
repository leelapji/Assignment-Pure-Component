# Performance Comparison

The PureCounterComponent performs better because PureComponent implements `shouldComponentUpdate` with a shallow comparison of state and props. This prevents unnecessary re-renders when state or props haven't changed. In contrast, SimpleCounterComponent re-renders every time, regardless of state or props changes.
